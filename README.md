# E-commerce Clothing Store Database Design Documentation

## 1. System Overview

This database design implements a scalable e-commerce platform specialized for clothing retail, with built-in flexibility for future expansion. The system supports complex product hierarchies, variant management, and comprehensive product information storage.

## 2. Database Schema Overview

### Core Entities
```
MainCategory → Category → Subcategory → Product → ProductVariant
                                     Product → ProductImage
                                     Product → ProductRating
```

### Database Statistics
- Total Tables: 7
- Primary Relationships: 6
- Unique Constraints: 5
- Foreign Key Relationships: 6

## 3. Table Structure Details

### Product Hierarchy
1. **MainCategory**
   - Primary categories (e.g., Clothing, Accessories)
   - UUID-based identification
   - Unique slugs for URL-friendly navigation
   
2. **Category**
   - Secondary level categorization
   - Linked to MainCategory via foreign key
   - Composite unique constraint on [mainCategoryId, slug]
   
3. **Subcategory**
   - Detailed product classification
   - Linked to Category via foreign key
   - Composite unique constraint on [categoryId, slug]

### Product Information
4. **Product**
   - Core product details
   - Base pricing information
   - Slug-based unique identification for SEO
   - Feature flagging capability (isFeatured)
   
5. **ProductVariant**
   - Size and color combinations
   - Individual pricing and stock management
   - Composite unique constraint on [productId, size, color]

### Supporting Entities
6. **ProductImage**
   - Multiple images per product
   - Primary image flagging
   - Display order management
   
7. **ProductRating**
   - Customer feedback system
   - Verified purchase tracking
   - One rating per user per product

## 4. Key Features

### Data Integrity
- UUID primary keys for distributed system compatibility
- Comprehensive foreign key constraints
- Soft delete capability via isActive flags
- Automatic timestamp management (createdAt, updatedAt)

### Performance Optimizations
- Strategic indexing on frequently queried columns
- Normalized structure to minimize redundancy
- Efficient data types (Decimal for prices, etc.)
- Composite indexes for common query patterns

### Scalability Features
- Flexible category hierarchy
- Independent variant management
- Extensible image system
- Separated rating system

## 5. Relationship Details

### One-to-Many Relationships
1. MainCategory → Category
   - One main category can have multiple categories
   - Example: "Clothing" → ["Pullovers", "Pants", "T-shirts"]

2. Category → Subcategory
   - One category can have multiple subcategories
   - Example: "Pullovers" → ["Hoodies", "Sweatshirts"]

3. Product → ProductVariant
   - One product can have multiple size/color combinations
   - Example: "Classic Black Hoodie" → ["S/Black", "M/Black", "L/Black"]

### Supporting Relationships
1. Product → ProductImage
   - Multiple images per product
   - Primary image flagging
   - Ordered display capability

2. Product → ProductRating
   - Multiple customer ratings per product
   - Verified purchase tracking
   - One rating per user enforcement

## 6. Technical Specifications

### Data Types
- IDs: UUID (string)
- Prices: Decimal(10,2)
- Dates: DateTime with timezone
- Text: String with appropriate constraints
- Status Flags: Boolean

### Indexes
- Primary Keys: UUID on all tables
- Foreign Keys: Referenced table relationships
- Unique Constraints: 
  - MainCategory: name, slug
  - Product: slug
  - ProductVariant: [productId, size, color]
  - ProductRating: [productId, userId]

## 7. Best Practices Implementation

### Naming Conventions
- camelCase for field names in Prisma
- snake_case mapping for PostgreSQL
- Consistent plural table names
- Clear, descriptive field names

### Data Management
- Soft delete implementation
- Automated timestamp handling
- Version tracking via updatedAt
- Stock quantity tracking
- Status management via isActive flags

## 8. Security Considerations

- No sensitive data in plain text
- Proper data type constraints
- Activity tracking fields
- User verification for ratings
- Purchase verification system

## 9. Future Expansion Capabilities

The design allows for:
1. New product categories
2. Additional product attributes
3. Enhanced rating features
4. Extended image capabilities
5. Inventory management expansion

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
